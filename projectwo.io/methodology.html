    <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
    <h1>The infographic presented is a map of Baltimore with the location of 16,671 vacant homes in the area. I went with the concept of a map because it gave the viewer a visual understanding of the amount of buildings in the area. The map itself is important because it not only provides the viewer with locations of the vacant buildings, but it makes the viewer aware of an economic problem. Instead of hearing the number of vacant buildings in the Baltimore area, they can see visually see it. <span class="note">Having a visual representation of any form of data presents a powerful message which captures the attention of the audience.</span> In this context, the map is meant to stimulate people's awareness of vacant buildings in the community.
